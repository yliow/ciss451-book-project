\section{Multiplication: Karatsuba algorithm}

Skip this section if you have already taken CISS358.

It turns out that there is a better way to multiply integers.
This was only discovered very recently in the 1960 

The idea is surprisingly simple.
Here's a basic formula:
\[
(aT + b)(cT + d) = acT^2 + (ad + bc)T + bd
\]
For now you can pretend that $T = 10$ and $a,b,c,d$ are digits.
For instance to multiply $23$ and $45$, you can view it as
\[
(2 \cdot 10 + 3)(4 \cdot 10 + 5)
= (2 \cdot 4) 10^2 + (2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 4) 10 + 3 \cdot 5
\]
You can finish up this computation on your own.

But 
\[
(aT + b)(cT + d) = acT^2 + (ad + bc)T + bd
\]
doesn't really help!!!
Viewing $T = 10$ and the $a,b,c,d$ as digits, the above
multiplication of two 2-digit numbers, i.e. 
$(aT + b)$ and $(cT + d)$, we need
\textit{ four} multiplications
\[
ac, \,\,\, 
ad, \,\,\,
bc, \,\,\,
bd
\]
So it's still essentially an $n^2$ algorithm.
In general if $T(n)$ is runtime of multiplying 2 integers of length $n$,
then
\[
T(n) = 4T(n/2) + An + B
\]
If $n = 2^k$, then
\begin{align*}
T(2^k) &= 4T(2^{k-1}) + A2^k + B \\
&= 4(4T(2^{k-2}) + A2^{k-1} + B) + A2^k + B \\
&= 4^2T(2^{k-2}) + (4 \cdot 2^{k-1} + 2^k)A + (4 + 1) B \\
&= 4^2(4T(2^{k-3}) + A2^{k-2} + B) + (4 \cdot 2^{k-1} + 2^k)A + (4 + 1)B \\
&= 4^3T(2^{k-3}) + (4^2 \cdot 2^{k-2} + 4 \cdot 2^{k-1} + 2^k)A + (4^2 + 4 + 1)B \\
&= ... \\
&= 4^kT(2^{k-k}) + (4^{k-1} \cdot 2^{1} + ... + 4^2 \cdot 2^{k-2} + 4 \cdot 2^{k-1} + 2^k)A + (4^{k-1} + ... + 4^2 + 4 + 1)B
\end{align*}
The coefficient for $B$ is $\displaystyle \frac{4^k - 1}{4 - 1}$.
The coefficient for $A$ is
\[
4^{k-1} \cdot 2^{1} + ... + 4^2 \cdot 2^{k-2} + 4 \cdot 2^{k-1} + 2^k
=
2^{2k - 1}
+ 2^{k + 2}
+ 2^{k + 1}
+ 2^k
= 2^k(1 + 2 + ... + 2^{k-1})
= 2^k(2^k - 1)
\]
Hence
\[
T(2^k) = 4^k T(1) + 2^k(2^k - 1) A + \frac{4^k - 1}{3} B
\]
Hence $T(1) = C$:
\[
T(2^k) = 4^k C + 2^k(2^k - 1) A + \frac{4^k - 1}{3} B
\]
Since $n = 2^k$,
\[
T(n) = n^2 C + n(n - 1) A + \frac{n^2 - 1}{3} B
\]
Clearly $T(n) = O(n^2)$.

But wait ... here's the brilliant (but simple) idea from Karatsuba.
Note that 
\begin{align*}
            (a+b)(c+d) &= ac + ad + bc + bd \\
\THEREFORE\,\,\,  (a+b)(c+d) - ac - bd &= ad + bc
\end{align*}
In other words
\[
(aT + b)(cT + d) = (ac)T^2 + [(a+b)(c+d) - (ac) - (bd)]T + (bd)
\]
If you count all the operations on the right,
you would see that there are only
\textit{ three} multiplications!!!

So we can do this:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
1. Compute A = ac         ... 1 multiplication
2. Compute B = bd         ... 1 multiplication
3. Compute C = (a+b)(c+d) ... 2 additions, 1 multiplication
4. Compute D = C - A - B  ... 2 subtractions
5. Output AT^2 + DT + B
\end{Verbatim}

Note that the runtime for subtraction is like addition.
In other words addition and subtraction are \lq\lq cheap'':
they are both $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the integers.

Practically speaking, how is Karatsuba actually used? 
Suppose you have to multiply two 8-digit numbers:
\[
12345678 \times 13572468
\]
We split them up into this (with $T = 10$)
\[
(1234T^4 + 5678) \times (1357T^4 + 2468)
\]
by Karatsuba
\begin{align*}
(a T^4 + b) \times (c T^4 + d) &= A (T^4)^2 + D (T^4) + B \\
A &= a b \\
B &= b d \\
C &= (a + b)(c + d) \\
D &= C - A - B
\end{align*}
Next, we
\textit{ again} apply Karasuba but this time to the products
$a b, b d, (a + b)(c + d)$.
Etc. 
In other words you recursively use Karatsuba
until the products involve numbers which are small enough
that we can perform them quickly without Karatsuba,
If we starting with the multiplication of two 8-digit numbers.
We're left with three multiplications of 4-digit numbers.
On applying Karasuba to the three multiplications of 4-digits numbers,
each multiplication gives rise to 3 2-digit numbers.
There are now $3 \times 3$ multiplications of 2-digit
numbers.
Going further, we get $3 \times 3 \times 3$ multiplication of 1-digit
numbers.

Here's an example.
Suppose we want to multiply
\[
1234 \times 1357
\]

\underline{Step 1: $(1234)(1357)$}.
\begin{align*}
(1234)(1357)
&= (12T^2 + 34) \times (13T^2 + 57) \\
&= A (T^2)^2 + D T^2 + B
\end{align*}
($T = 10$)
where
\begin{align*}
a &= 12, \,\,\, b = 34, \,\,\, c = 13, \,\,\, d = 57 \\
A &= a c = (12)(13)\\
B &= b d = (34)(57)\\
C &= (a + b) (c + d) = (46)(70)\\
D &= C - A - B
\end{align*}

\underline{Step 2: $(12)(34)$}.
\begin{align*}
(12)(13) 
&= (1T^1 + 2) \times (1T^1 + 3) \\
&= A (T^1)^2 + D T^1 + B 
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
a &= 1, \,\,\, b = 2, \,\,\, c = 1, \,\,\, d = 3 \\
A &= a c = (1)(1) = 1\\
B &= b d = (2)(3) = 6\\
C &= (a + b) (c + d) = (3)(4) = 12\\
D &= C - A - B = 12 - 1 - 6 = 5
\end{align*}
So
\begin{align*}
(12)(34) = 1(T^1)^2 + 5T^1 + 6 = 100 + 50 + 6 = 156 
\end{align*}

\underline{Step 3: $(34)(57)$}
\[
(34)(57) = (3T^1 + 4) \times (5T^1 + 7) =  A(T^1)^2 + DT^1 + B 
\]
where
\begin{align*}
a &= 3, \,\,\, b = 4, \,\,\, c = 5, d = 7 \\
A &= a c = (3)(5) = 15\\
B &= b d = (4)(7) = 28\\
C &= (a + b) (c + d) = (7)(12) = 84\\
D &= C - A - B = 84 - 15 - 28 = 41
\end{align*}
So
\begin{align*}
(34)(57) = 15(T^1)^2 + 41T^1 + 28 = 1500 + 410 + 28 = 1938 
\end{align*}

\underline{Step 4: $(46)(70)$}.
\[
(46)(70) 
= (4T^1 + 6) \times (7T^1 + 0) = A(T^1)^2 + DT^1 + B 
\]
where
\begin{align*}
a &= 4, \,\,\, b = 6, \,\,\, c = 7, \,\,\, d = 0 \\
A &= a c = (4)(7) = 28\\
B &= b d = (6)(0) = 0\\
C &= (a + b) (c + d) = (10)(7) = 70\\
D &= C - A - B = 70 - 28 - 0 = 42
\end{align*}
So
\begin{align*}
(46)(70) = 28(T^1)^2 + 42T^1 + 0 = 2800 + 420 + 0 = 3220 
\end{align*}

Putting Steps 2,3,4 back into Step 1 ...

\underline{Continuing Step 1: (1234)(1357)}.
\begin{align*}
(1234)(1357)
&= (12T^2 + 34) \times (13T^2 + 57) \\
&= A (T^2)^2 + D T^2 + B
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
a &= 12, \,\,\, b = 34, \,\,\, c = 13, \,\,\, d = 57 \\
A &= (12)(13) = 156    & & \text{from Step 1}\\
B &= (34)(57) = 1938   & & \text{from Step 2} \\
C &= (46)(70) = 3220   & & \text{from Step 3} \\
D &= C - A - B = 3220 - 156 - 1938 = 1126
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
(1234)(1357)  
&= A(T^2)^2 + D T^2 + B \\
&= 156(T^2)^2 + 1126 T^2 + 1938 \\
&= 1560000 + 112600 + 1938 \\
&= 1674538
\end{align*}

Now if you go back and look for the multiplications you see these:
\begin{align*}
(1)(1) &= 1\\
(2)(3) &= 6\\
(3)(4) &= 12\\
(3)(5) &= 15\\
(4)(7) &= 28\\
(7)(12) &= 84\\
(4)(7) &= 28\\
(6)(0) &= 0\\
(10)(7) &= 70\\
\end{align*}
i.e., $9 = 3^2$ multiplications if we multiply two 
integers of length $n = 2^2$.
High-school multiplication would require $n^2 = (2^2)^2 = 16$
multiplications.


Now let us compute the runtime of Karatsuba's algorithm:

\begin{prop}
  The runtime of Karatsuba is $O(n^{\lg 3}) = O(n^{1.5849...})$
  where $n$ is the length of the integers to be multiplied.
\end{prop}
\proof
TODO
\qed

The above result is the same whether you view your integer as an array
of decimals or as an array of bits.

It's a good exercise to implement Karatsuba on your own.
I did some number theory crunching programming during the
summer of my freshman
year and a prof gave me a copy of the original 
paper published by Karatsuba.
(Karatsuba's paper has since inspired several improvements.)
As you see from the above, the amount of math that you need to know
is pretty minimal.
Basically the ingredients are
\[
(aT + b)(cT + d) = acT^2 + (ad + bc)T + bd
\]
(which is not new) and this (which is new):
\begin{align*}
(a+b)(c+d) &= ac + ad + bc + bd \\
\THEREFORE \,\,\, (a+b)(c+d) - ac - bd &= ad + bc
\end{align*}

There are various obvious optimizations which only tweaks the
constants of your big-O, but not the big-O itself. 
For instance if you look at this addition:
\begin{align*}
(1234)(1357)  
&= A(T^2)^2 + D T^2 + B \\
&= 156(T^2)^2 + 1126 T^2 + 1938 \\
&= 1560000 + 112600 + 1938 \\
&= 1674538
\end{align*}
you'll see that you are adding $1560000$ with another number $112600$.
There are some zeroes in $112600$.
So you might want to have a function that adds say $1126$ to an integer
starting at the 100s digit position.
This will speed up for instance adding to an integer $123456789123456789$, 
the number
$123000000000000$:
\begin{Verbatim}
          123456789123456789
        +    123000000000000
        --------------------

        --------------------
               ^
               |
               start column addition here
\end{Verbatim}

Another thing to note is that our computers are mostly 32 bit machines.
If you're using an array of integers to model long integers,
you only want to cut up the integers up to a certain point, and not
to the digit-level.
For instance you might want to model your long integers
with arrays of 16-bit integers.
Note that the process of cutting up the integers into pieces
takes time.
In fact when the number of digits is small, highschool multiplication
might be faster.
Therefore you want to write your code in such as way that 
if the length of the integers is less than a certain constant,
then highschool multiplication is used;
if the length is greater than this constant, then Karatsuba is used.
That's what I did.

(The language I used long long long time ago to do Karatsuba
was Pascal.
Each element of the array models 0 to 999.
I found through timed testing that if the array has length $\leq 5$,
then highschool multiplication was actually faster.
This is of course machine specific.
This explains why when you install some number crunching libraries,
before the installation is completed, it will tests the code to tweak
such constants for maximum performance.)

OK. 
Enough hints.
You should go ahead and write a long integer package that 
incorporates 
Karatsuba for multiplication.

\begin{ex}
Compute $1122334455667788 \times 8765432187654321$ using
Karasuba multiplication to continually breakdown the integers
up to integers of length 2;
use your calculator to perform multiplication of length 2 integers.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
Implement a long integer class where multiplication uses
Karasuba.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
The algorithmic analysis above is basically correct
but some details are actually missing.
Write a research paper on Karatsuba, describing the algorithm in detail,
and analyze the runtime performance exactly.
Research also on efficient implementation of Karatsuba.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}$^*$
Since the surprising (shocking?) discovery of Karatsuba,
several improvements to his algorithm has appeared since the 60s.
Write a research paper on the various new-fangled integer multiplication
algorithms, analyze and comparison their runtime performance.
